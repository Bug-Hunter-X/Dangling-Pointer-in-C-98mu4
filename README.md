This repository demonstrates a common C programming error: the dangling pointer. The bug.c file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.c provides a corrected version.  Dangling pointers occur when a pointer references a memory location that has been deallocated or is no longer valid. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes. The solution demonstrates a way to avoid this issue.
